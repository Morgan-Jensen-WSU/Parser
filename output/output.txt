num x = 4 + 6                                           is valid.
The answer is 10
The postfix IR is num x = 4 6 + 

num y                                                   is valid.

printString "  Enter a number for y "                   is valid.

readNum y                                               is valid.

printString "  The value of x is: "                     is valid.

printNum x                                              is valid.
The answer is 10
The postfix IR is printNum x 

printString "  The value of y is: "                     is valid.

printNum y                                              is valid.
